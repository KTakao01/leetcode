# 20. Valid Parentheses
# Easy
# Topics
# Companies
# Hint
# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

# An input string is valid if:

# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:

        # ({)} is true?
        # If you don’t care about the order in which the brackets are closed, as in the example above, you can simply run a loop.
        hashmap = {"(":")","{":"}","[":"]"}
        openS = []
        closeS = []
        for i in range(len(s)) :         
            if s[i] == "(" or s[i] == "{" or s[i] == "[":
                openS.append(s[i])
                closeS.append(hashmap[s[i]])
            else:
                # 組み合わせとして先に閉じ括弧が来るときはfalse
                if closeS == []: return False
                openS.append(closeS.pop())
        if len(openS) % 2 == 1 or len(closeS) != 0 : 
            return False
        return s == ''.join(openS)
